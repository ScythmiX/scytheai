# ScytheAI

**Skill Showcase Project** — This project is a portfolio piece, not meant for production.

ScytheAI is a conceptual interface for an AI productivity tool designed to demonstrate practical frontend engineering skills. The project integrates a multi-section UI, reactive components, and a custom 3D environment. It is intended as a professional portfolio piece rather than a production application.

The central visual element is a Three.js background scene featuring glowing square elements that subtly track the user's scroll position. This interaction produces a clean, modern motion effect without distracting from the interface. The foreground UI is built with React and TailwindCSS, using modular components and structured data pipelines to preserve clarity and maintainability.

The project reflects real-world frontend workflows: a separate rendering layer, component-driven UI, reusable widget-level elements, and a clear directory hierarchy.
